# LetterFrequency-MAT291
This is a small program that I created because I was really unsure of how many letters there were in the
Masc cipher I was trying to break. 

#HOW IT WORKS: 
1. Clone the source code
2. Compile the source code using g++, clang++, etc...
3. Run the code using ./main
4. You're going to have to run the program multiple times, the prompts will be: "Enter Letter" and "Enter Message"
5. Repeat step 4 over and over again.
